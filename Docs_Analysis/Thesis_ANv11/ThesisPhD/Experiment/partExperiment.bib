abstract = "One source of experimental background in the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is particles entering the detectors from the machine. These particles are created in cascades, caused by upstream interactions of beam protons with residual gas molecules or collimators. We estimate the losses on the collimators with SixTrack and simulate the showers with FLUKA and MARS to obtain the flux and distribution of particles entering the ATLAS and CMS detectors. We consider some machine configurations used in the first LHC run, with focus on 3.5TeV operation as in 2011. Results from FLUKA and MARS are compared and a very good agreement is found. An analysis of logged LHC data provides, for different processes, absolute beam loss rates, which are used together with further simulations of vacuum conditions to normalize the results to rates of particles entering the detectors. We assess the relative importance of background from elastic and inelastic beam–gas interactions, and the leakage out of the LHC collimation system, and show that beam–gas interactions are the dominating source of machine-induced background for the studied machine scenarios. Our results serve as a starting point for the experiments to perform further simulations in order to estimate the resulting signals in the detectors."

	annote = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion
detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction
sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of
strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values
of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides
running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with
lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs.
ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to
collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several
QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors.
The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently
over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. 
Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m3 with a total weight 
of approximately
10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each
with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven
both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected
at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme
particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The
different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum
resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad
range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC.
This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons,
and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei.
Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data 
taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, 
with the exception of
parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector
(TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be
completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010.
This paper describes in detail the detector components as
installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.}

calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values

The physics goal is to provide data for calibrating the hadron interaction
models that are used in the study of Extremely High-Energy Cosmic-Rays.
This is possible since the laboratory equivalent collision energy of LHC is 
1017 eV.
Two LHCf detectors, consisting of imaging calorimeters made of tungsten 
plates, plastic scintillator and position sensitive sensors, are installed at 
zero degree collision angle ±140 m from an interaction point (IP).
Although the lateral dimensions of these calorimeters are very compact,
ranging from 20 mm × 20 mm to 40 mm × 40 mm, the energy 
resolution is expected to be better than 6% and the position resolution better
than 0.2 mm for γ-rays with energy from 100 GeV to 7 TeV.
This has been confirmed by test beam results at the CERN SPS.
These calorimeters can measure particles emitted in the pseudo rapidity
range η > 8.4.
Detectors, data acquisition and electronics are optimized to operate during
the early phase of the LHC commissioning with luminosity below 
1030 cm-2 s-1. LHCf is expected to obtain data to compare with the major hadron interaction models within a week or so of operation at luminosity  ∼ 1029 cm-2 s-1. After ∼ 10 days of operation at luminosity 
 ∼ 1029 cm-2 s-1, the light output of the plastic scintillators is expected to degrade by ∼ 10% due to radiation damage.
This degradation will be monitored and corrected for using calibration
pulses from a laser.}
